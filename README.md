Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values and clean the data.
Feature Engineering: Calculate director success rate and average rating of similar movies.
Encoding: Convert categorical data to numerical using Label Encoding.
Model Building: Train a Random Forest Regressor.
Evaluation: Evaluate using RMSE and R² Score.

Results
RMSE: 0.5731
R² Score: 0.6622
